# Recent Updates Summary

## Version: October 16, 2025

### 1. Market Hours Checking ✨ NEW
- **Automatic market hours detection** before running checks
- Uses US/Eastern timezone to determine if market is open (Mon-Fri 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
- Shows clear status messages when market is closed
- New `--skip-market-check` flag to bypass checking (useful for paper trading)
- Added `pytz` dependency for timezone handling

**New Functions in `utils.py`:**
- `is_market_open()` - Returns True/False if market is currently open
- `get_market_status()` - Returns detailed market status dictionary

**Usage:**
```bash
# Normal operation (checks market hours)
python3 roll_monitor.py --once

# Skip market hours check
python3 roll_monitor.py --once --skip-market-check
```

### 2. Improved NaN/None Handling & Critical Data Validation ✨ ENHANCED
- **Better handling of missing data** (expired options, no market data)
- **Critical data validation** before scanning for rolls
- Positions with missing critical data are skipped with clear messages
- Distinction between expected (expiring soon) and unexpected (data issues) problems
- Spot price shows "N/A" instead of "nan" when unavailable
- Buyback cost treated as $0 for expired options (shows N/A in display)
- Delta, P&L, and all numeric fields handle None/NaN gracefully
- ROI calculation protected against division by zero/None

**Validation Rules:**
- Missing price + DTE ≤ 2: ⏭️ SKIP (Expected for expiring options)
- Missing price + DTE > 2: ⚠️ ERROR (Unexpected data issue)
- No suitable expiry found: ⚠️ ERROR (No target in 30-45 DTE range)
- Summary shows counts of found/skipped/errors

**Changed Files:**
- `display.py` - Added `math.isnan()` checks throughout
- `options_finder.py` - Validates critical data, returns error dict if missing
- `roll_monitor.py` - Handles error responses with appropriate messaging
- All numeric formatting now checks for None/NaN before display

### 3. Enhanced Stock Price Retrieval
- **Multiple exchange fallback** for stock price lookup
- Tries: NASDAQ → NYSE → SMART → No primaryExchange
- Longer sleep time (0.8s) to allow data to populate
- Should fix "Spot: $nan" issues

**Updated in `market_data.py`:**
```python
def get_stock_price(ib, symbol):
    # Tries multiple exchanges with error handling
    for exchange in ['NASDAQ', 'NYSE', 'SMART']:
        # ... attempt to get price
    # Falls back to SMART without primaryExchange
```

### 4. ROI Calculation & Color Coding (Previous Update)
- **ROI% metric**: (Net Credit / New Premium) × 100
- **Color-coded output** based on ROI thresholds:
  - 🟢 Excellent (≥90%): Bright Green
  - 🟢 Good (≥75%): Green  
  - 🟡 Moderate (≥50%): Yellow
  - 🔴 Poor (>0%): Red
  - 🔴 Negative (≤0%): Dark Red
- **Automatic sorting** by ROI (best to worst)

## Files Modified

### Core Code:
1. **`utils.py`** - Added market hours checking functions
2. **`roll_monitor.py`** - Integrated market hours check into main loop
3. **`display.py`** - Improved NaN/None handling, color coding
4. **`options_finder.py`** - Better handling of missing buyback costs
5. **`market_data.py`** - Multi-exchange stock price retrieval

### Dependencies:
6. **`requirements.txt`** - Added `pytz` for timezone support

### Documentation:
7. **`README.md`** - Updated with ROI and color coding features
8. **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Added ROI calculations and visual design section

---

## Testing

All changes tested and verified:
```bash
# Run smoke tests
python3 test_refactor.py

# Test market hours
python3 -c "from utils import get_market_status; print(get_market_status())"

# Test with missing data handling
python3 roll_monitor.py --dte-threshold 40 --once
```

---

## Breaking Changes

None - all changes are backward compatible.

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Holiday calendar** - Check for market holidays
2. **Extended hours support** - Pre-market and after-hours options
3. **Configurable ROI thresholds** - User-defined color coding
4. **Historical ROI tracking** - Store and analyze past rolls
5. **Email/SMS alerts** - Notifications when high-ROI rolls available

---

## Installation/Update

```bash
# Update dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify installation
python3 test_refactor.py
```

---

**Summary:** The tool is now more robust with market hours checking, better error handling for missing data, and improved stock price retrieval. All previous features (ROI calculation, color coding, delta analysis) remain intact and enhanced.
